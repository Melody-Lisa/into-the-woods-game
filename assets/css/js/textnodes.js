        You decide to hand over the amulet to the shadowy figures. As you place the amulet in their outstretched, 
        ghostly hands, an eerie calm descends upon the cemetery. The figures slowly fade away into the darkness, 
        taking the amulet with them.
        <p>You and your friend are left bewildered, with more questions than answers. As the shadows recede,

        <p>With the amulet now gone and the shadowy figures dispersed, you choose to heed their warning. You and your friend
